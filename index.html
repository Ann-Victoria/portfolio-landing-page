    <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
    <span>Victoria is a person striving to be a better person financially, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, well basically in all aspects that do matter.
      My first degree is a <span>achelor in Arts in International Relations</span>
      I have a variety of things that i love to do. I love reading novels, whenever I read its as if I'm transported into that world and get to watch the story unfold.
      Listening to music is good for the soul, my favorite band has to be BTS and my favorite song is their new single "Permission to Dance". 
      I also watch movies, I'm fascinated by other languages and culture, my preferred movies are korean, chinese and indian.
      I joined Moringa School to get programming skills that will inevitably be of much importance in the job market.
      Software development is also an added advantage when taking some degrees such as financial engineering.
      Moringa school is the best option where I can build this new set of coding skills and embrace this new venture in my life.</p>
